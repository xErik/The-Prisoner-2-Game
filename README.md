**Game: The Prisoner by Edu-Ware, David Mullich**

This repository holds the extracted source code of the game
*The Prisoner*.

The game had been created by Edu-Ware in 1980. Edu-Ware closed 1985.

I was not able to determine who currently owns the rights. There are many binary versions of it distributed on the internet already.

### Note

*The Prisoner 2* is a visually enhanced version of *The Prisoner*.
